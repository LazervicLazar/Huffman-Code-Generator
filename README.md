# Huffman-Code-Generator
## Introduction

Huffman coding is a widely used algorithm for data compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes given to more frequent characters. This project provides a C++ implementation of Huffman coding, allowing you to compress and decompress text efficiently.

## Features

- Compress text using Huffman coding.
- Decompress Huffman-encoded text.
- Interactive menu-based interface for user convenience.
- Simple and easy-to-understand C++ code.
